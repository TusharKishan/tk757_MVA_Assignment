#1) Performing a univariate analysis on the laptop Brands Dell and HP with each of the following parameters, such as RAM size, weight, price etc and determining the mean of each?

#t tests
with(data=Laptop,t.test(Processor_Speed[Brand=="Dell"],Processor_Speed[Brand=="HP"],var.equal=TRUE))
with(data=Laptop,t.test(RAM_Size[Brand=="Dell"],RAM_Size[Brand=="HP"],var.equal=TRUE))
with(data=Laptop,t.test(Storage_Capacity[Brand=="Dell"],Storage_Capacity[Brand=="HP"],var.equal=TRUE))
with(data=Laptop,t.test(Screen_Size[Brand=="Dell"],Screen_Size[Brand=="HP"],var.equal=TRUE))
with(data=Laptop,t.test(Weight[Brand=="Dell"],Weight[Brand=="HP"],var.equal=TRUE))
with(data=Laptop,t.test(Price[Brand=="Dell"],Price[Brand=="HP"],var.equal=TRUE))

#Ans) The t-value indicates how different the means of the two groups are relative to the variance in the data. A larger t-value suggests a greater difference between the means.The p-value is the probability of observing such an extreme difference in means if the true difference is actually zero. A low p-value (typically below 0.05) suggests that the observed difference is unlikely to be due to random chance.The 95% confidence interval provides a range of values within which we can be 95% confident that the true difference in means lies. In this case, the interval includes zero, indicating that we cannot be confident that there is a true difference between the processor speeds of Dell and HP laptops.

#2) Performing a univariate analysis on the laptop brands Asus and Acer using two of its paramaeters, RAM size and price, and determining the variance for both?

#F tests
attach(Laptop)
var.test(RAM_Size[Brand=="Asus"],RAM_Size[Brand=="Acer"])
var.test(Price[Brand=="Asus"],Price[Brand=="Acer"])

#Ans 1) This first analysis compares the variances of RAM sizes between Asus and Acer laptops and the second analysis compares the variances of Prices between Asus and Acer laptops.The F-value is a measure of the ratio of variances. It compares how much the data points vary from the mean within each group relative to the variance between the group means. A value close to 1 suggests that the variances are similar.The degrees of freedom for the numerator are related to the precision of the estimate. Higher degrees of freedom generally indicate more reliable results.

#3) Performing a multivariate study on laptop brands using the all of its parameters and computing the mean?

#Hotelling test
library(Hotelling)
new_test <- hotelling.test(Processor_Speed + RAM_Size + Storage_Capacity + Screen_Size + Weight +Price ~ Brand, data=Laptop)

cat("T2 statistic =",new_test$stat[[1]],"\n")
print(new_test)

#Ans)This analysis uses a T² statistic to compare multiple means simultaneously. The T² statistic value is 4.187586, and it is used to test whether there are significant differences between the means of multiple groups.In this analysis, with a p-value of 0.6853, we do not have enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis, which would suggest that there are no significant differences between the group means.


#4) Performing a multivariate analysis on the laptop brands to determine their variance.

#Manova
summary(manova(as.matrix(Laptop[,-1])~ Brand))

#Ans)This analysis is a multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA) assessing the effect of the "Brand" variable on several dependent variables simultaneously.In this analysis, the p-value of 0.9629 indicates that there is no significant effect of the "Brand" variable on the dependent variables.
